## Key Features

1. **Requirement Gathering**: Collects client project requirements through natural conversation
2. **Information Extraction**: Extracts key details like project type, timeline, and budget
3. **Lead Storage**: Stores lead information in Google Sheets for follow-up
4. **Conversation Management**: Maintains context throughout the conversation
5. **Summarization**: Provides a summary of the gathered information
6. **Testing Mode**: Supports testing without external dependencies using mock services
