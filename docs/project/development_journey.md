- Created this development journey document to capture the project's evolution

## Technical Decisions and Rationales

### 1. FastAPI as Backend Framework

**Decision**: Use FastAPI for the backend API.

**Rationale**:
- Performance: FastAPI is one of the fastest Python frameworks
- Async Support: Native support for asynchronous operations
- Type Hints: Built-in support for Python type hints
- Documentation: Automatic API documentation with Swagger UI
- Middleware: Easy integration of middleware for authentication, CORS, etc.

### 2. LiteLLM for Model Integration

**Decision**: Use LiteLLM as the interface to OpenAI's models.

**Rationale**:
- Unified Interface: Provides a consistent interface to multiple LLM providers
- Fallback Support: Can fallback to alternative models if needed
- Caching: Built-in caching to reduce API calls
- Logging: Comprehensive logging of requests and responses
- Cost Tracking: Helps track token usage and costs

### 3. CSV Storage over Google Sheets

**Decision**: Replace Google Sheets with local CSV storage.

**Rationale**:
- Simplicity: No external API dependencies
- Performance: Faster read/write operations
- Reliability: No network-related failures
- Privacy: Data remains local to the application
- Portability: Easier deployment without authentication setup
- Testing: Simpler to mock for testing purposes

### 4. State-Based Conversation Flow

**Decision**: Implement a state-based approach for conversation management.

**Rationale**:
- Structure: Provides a clear structure to the conversation
- Predictability: Makes the conversation flow more predictable
- Extraction: Easier to extract specific information at each state
- Recovery: Allows for graceful recovery from unexpected inputs
- Extensibility: New states can be added without affecting existing ones

### 5. Comprehensive Testing Framework

**Decision**: Create a robust testing framework with mock services.

**Rationale**:
- Reliability: Ensures the application works as expected
- Independence: Tests can run without external dependencies
- Coverage: Tests all aspects of the application
- Automation: Tests can be automated in CI/CD pipelines
- Documentation: Tests serve as executable documentation

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Managing Conversation Context

**Problem**: Maintaining context throughout a conversation while handling state transitions.

**Solution**:
- Implemented a session-based approach to store conversation history
- Created a state machine to manage transitions between conversation states
- Used the LLM's context window to maintain coherence in responses
- Added metadata to track important information across states

### Challenge 2: Entity Extraction Accuracy

**Problem**: Accurately extracting specific entities (like contact info, project requirements) from free-form text.

**Solution**:
- Crafted specific prompts for the LLM to focus on entity extraction
- Implemented validation for extracted entities
- Added fallback mechanisms when extraction fails
- Created a feedback loop to improve extraction over time

### Challenge 3: Testing Without External Dependencies

**Problem**: Testing the application without relying on OpenAI's API or file system access.

**Solution**:
- Created mock implementations of all external services
- Implemented a testing mode controlled by environment variables
- Designed tests to work with both real and mock services
- Added comprehensive test scenarios to cover edge cases

### Challenge 4: Balancing Logging Detail

**Problem**: Finding the right balance between detailed logging and performance/clarity.

**Solution**:
- Implemented configurable log levels through environment variables
- Created focused logging for critical operations like LLM requests
- Added structured logging for easier parsing and analysis
- Implemented log rotation to manage log file size

## Lessons Learned

1. **Start Simple, Then Expand**: Beginning with a focused scope allowed for rapid development and iteration.

2. **Prioritize Local Solutions**: Local storage (CSV) proved more reliable and simpler than external services (Google Sheets).

3. **Invest in Testing**: The comprehensive testing framework paid dividends in catching issues early and ensuring reliability.

4. **Document as You Go**: Maintaining documentation alongside code development kept it accurate and up-to-date.

5. **Modular Architecture**: The modular design made it easier to replace components (like switching from Google Sheets to CSV).

6. **Environment Configuration**: Using environment variables for configuration provided flexibility across different environments.

7. **Mock External Dependencies**: Creating mock implementations of external services greatly simplified testing.

## Future Development Directions

Based on the current state of the project, several promising directions for future development have been identified:

1. **Admin Dashboard**: Create a web-based dashboard for managing leads and viewing analytics.

2. **Email Notifications**: Add email notifications for new leads and follow-up reminders.

3. **CRM Integration**: Integrate with popular CRM systems like HubSpot or Salesforce.

4. **Multi-language Support**: Extend the chatbot to support multiple languages.

5. **Voice Interface**: Add support for voice input and output.

6. **Advanced Analytics**: Implement analytics to track conversation effectiveness and conversion rates.

7. **Improved Entity Extraction**: Enhance entity extraction accuracy with fine-tuned models.

8. **Conversation Templates**: Create templates for different types of products or services.
